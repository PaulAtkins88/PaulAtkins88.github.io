# Personal Profile

### The results of an online Myers-Briggs test. ![MBTI Result][mbtiResult]

The results of the MBTI test seem to make me feel like a fence sitter! with most of the personality traits being very even, tipping only so slightly in one direction. 
I agree that i am an extraverted person and dont have any trouble identifying in a group and I am energised by social interaction. Whilst I do like coding by myself, I do like to have input on design and how a program should function. Under the energy subtitle it calls me observant which is half correct, depends on the exercise. Listening to the wife about groceries and what needs to be done around the house? Not so much. When it comes to working on a group project this is correct i like to stay factual and keep a group moving forward rather than procrastation. I wouldnt put myself in the "Feeling" category though, I do believe in harmony in groups but struggle sometimes with other peoples emotions - "Lets just get it done!" Hence the next two titles puts me in the "Judging" & "Assertive" categories... agreed.



### The results of an online learning style test. ![Learning Style][learningStyle]

100% agree with this, I am a visual learner. I have self taught myself all my coding languages by reading pdf's, watching YouTube tutorials. It goes on to say that I have difficulty with spoken directions? Incorrect its how I learn! Following what someone is doing and then going to read about it to fully understand. "distracted by sounds"? Whilst writing this now I have two young kids running around screaming daddy whilst mum says please be quiet also have music in my ears so I dont know how accurate this one is.

### The results of one further online test of your choosing. ![Big Five Result][bigFiveResult]

I chose the Big Five test (was going to do a speed coder test, thought this might be more relevant). As per the MBTI test it puts me in the Extravert category, again I agree with this I enjoy group work, I get along well with others. 


### What do the results of these tests mean for you?

They are somewhat accurate. I dont believe people can be put in a box as humans are too diverse and situation/exposure can change anyones personality. That being said, I do like that it highlights some down points where you could work on behaviours to grow as a person.

### How do you think these results may influence your behaviour in a team?

As said before, the results highlight areas that may not be productive in a team environment. Giving insight on how you may improve in a group, maybe I am too extrovert? too rigid in my processes and need to more open minded. I will try and explore these traits before the group projects start.

### How should you take this into account when forming a team?

Try and align myself with other individuals that have high competencies to get a balanced group. Be mindful of my strong traits and possibly dial back a bit and listen.
