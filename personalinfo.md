# Personal Information

* Paul Atkins
* s3779053
* paulatkins88@gmail.com
* Studied Diploma of IT in 2005, Languages? Other than english? None. Coding? well a different answer.
* Hobbies - Goofing around with my kids! Watching trashy TV with my beautiful wife. In my personal time I write code, I am currently working on an android application specifically for my work that will calculate a years roster and display the current net take home dollar amount in 1 click (this is a bit tricky as we rotate 2 days, 2 nights, 4 off with different penalties depending on the day/night you are working.)
* Fun Fact - I like to play squash and go skateboarding with my daughters.
