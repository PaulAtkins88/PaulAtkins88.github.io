# Personal Information

* Paul Atkins
* s3779053
* paulatkins88@gmail.com
* Studied Diploma of IT in 2005, Languages? Other than english? None. Coding? well a different answer.
* Hobbies - Goofing around with my kids! Watching trashy TV with my beautiful wife. In my personal time I write code, I am currently working on an android application specifically for my work that will calculate a years roster and display the current net take home dollar amount in 1 click (this is a bit tricky as we rotate 2 days, 2 nights, 4 off with different penalties depending on the day/night you are working.)
* Fun Fact - I like to play squash and go skateboarding with my daughters.

# Interest in IT
### You should answer the questions below as best you can. Each answer should be one paragraph in length.
* What is your interest in IT? When did your interest in IT start? Was there a particular event or person that sparked your interest? Outline your IT experience (if any).

When I was 6 years old, just learning to read my dad gave me the "Disney's Computer Fun" <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BweO6Y13Cmc4dnhxanhoS3VfenM/view"><img src="img/disney_book.jpg" width="200" height="200" title="Disney's Computer Fun!" align="right"/></a>

I think we had a Commodore VIC20 at the time, I guess this is where I started gaining interest in computers. I started making programs that would print funny words or absolute jibberish my father has told me, after a few years i became more interested in the hardware side of things much to my fathers disgust when I pulled apart the IBM XT to see how it ticked. Move forward a few years into high school when i started programming with [Pascal][pascal_wiki] and starting with [C][c_wiki]. This took me into a CERT IV in Information Technology which at that age (16) I really didnt give it my all and instead chased the girls and was led astray... 

At about the age of 23-24 years old I was engaged and living with my now wife and decided to go back and finish my Diploma, I had to start again at CERT IV and then the Diploma the year after. After completing this the idea was to go into a Computing Science degree and I would continue on.

Life got in the way, My fiance wanted to finish her degree in Nursing so I put aside my education and got a full time job managing fast food restaurants. 
We then moved to Ballarat after she finished her degree so she could work at the Ballarat Base Hospital and I started work at Harvey Norman, which didnt last long and if you ask anyone who works there, they would understand why. 

My friend advised me of an opportunity arising in Ballarat with [ESTA][esta] working for 000 Emergency. I believed and still do believe that it is a rewarding career with alot of pathways to other roles inside the Emergency Services Sector and I applied.

Then comes Marriage, Children and a mortgage - Suddenly I cannot resume my goal of working in the IT environment due to the fact I cant drop wage a cent to pursue full time study.

Its then someone at work said "Hey have you had a look at [OUA][oua]? I got excited about the fact that I could work fulltime and study in the down periods and on my days off.

I chose RMIT over Swinburne primarily because "Royal Melbourne **Institute of Technology**" made sense to me wanting to do a Bachelors in Information Technology. After doing some research on the lectures and job opportunities at RMIT it just cemented by decision.

I then started diving in alot of online courses in Programming as that is where my passion lies.
I have completed many courses on
* Java
* C#
* JS
* Unity3D Game engine

My favourite has been Java as it is widely used on many devices and is the main language used in Android Application Development.

My expectation of this course is to come away with the qualifications required to move from Operations at ESTA to the ITS department where I can implement positive change to the way we handle information for the interim (Gotta pay the mortgage!) then move onto something like Google.

# Ideal Job
When i think of an ideal programmer career I think about Google. Maps, Street view, Android (yes i know didnt start at Google but was purchased by them in 2005), Web development the list is endless, hence the career possibilities aswell.

### A description (in your own words) of the position, and particularly what makes this position appealing to you.
Google are seeking a graduate after finishing university, someone to help with current projects and also to bring new ideas and new innovations. Google promote creativity! 
It is an engineering company, Sure there to make a buck but I believe are successful due to wanting to make the world of electronic engineering better than before. I would love to start a career with Google as I believe it would never become mundane, the possibilities alone to work in Australia, or anywhere in the world. And I hear they have a slide.

### A description (in your own words) of the skills, qualifications and experience required for the position.
They want a post grad, assuming adept knowledge in programming in some languages, not all. Understanding of IT, Software Development. Also mentions experience in networking prograaming (Assuming routing tables, maintaining patches, PowerShell). Experience in multiple OS (Operating Systems).

I possess the following skills relating to the role:
* OO (Object Orientated) programming languages. Java, C#, JS, Basic HTML, bash.
* Networking hardware. Router configuration, patch panels, installing rack mount hardware, 
* Working in teams groups 
* Excellent communication skills 
* Honesty & Integrity
* Fun to have around!


### A plan describing how you will obtain the skills, qualifications and experience required for the position, building on those you have now. This need not be greatly detailed, (and will probably change significantly over time anyway), but try to be as specific as you can.
My plan is to finish my Bachelors with RMIT! Keep my Linkedin profile up to date and pay attention to Googles development profile on Linkedin.


# Personal Profile

### The results of an online Myers-Briggs test. ![MBTI Result][mbtiResult]

The results of the MBTI test seem to make me feel like a fence sitter! with most of the personality traits being very even, tipping only so slightly in one direction. 
I agree that i am an extraverted person and dont have any trouble identifying in a group and I am energised by social interaction. Whilst I do like coding by myself, I do like to have input on design and how a program should function. Under the energy subtitle it calls me observant which is half correct, depends on the exercise. Listening to the wife about groceries and what needs to be done around the house? Not so much. When it comes to working on a group project this is correct i like to stay factual and keep a group moving forward rather than procrastation. I wouldnt put myself in the "Feeling" category though, I do believe in harmony in groups but struggle sometimes with other peoples emotions - "Lets just get it done!" Hence the next two titles puts me in the "Judging" & "Assertive" categories... agreed.



### The results of an online learning style test. ![Learning Style][learningStyle]

100% agree with this, I am a visual learner. I have self taught myself all my coding languages by reading pdf's, watching YouTube tutorials. It goes on to say that I have difficulty with spoken directions? Incorrect its how I learn! Following what someone is doing and then going to read about it to fully understand. "distracted by sounds"? Whilst writing this now I have two young kids running around screaming daddy whilst mum says please be quiet also have music in my ears so I dont know how accurate this one is.

### The results of one further online test of your choosing. ![Big Five Result][bigFiveResult]

I chose the Big Five test (was going to do a speed coder test, thought this might be more relevant). As per the MBTI test it puts me in the Extravert category, again I agree with this I enjoy group work, I get along well with others. 


### What do the results of these tests mean for you?

They are somewhat accurate. I dont believe people can be put in a box as humans are too diverse and situation/exposure can change anyones personality. That being said, I do like that it highlights some down points where you could work on behaviours to grow as a person.

### How do you think these results may influence your behaviour in a team?

As said before, the results highlight areas that may not be productive in a team environment. Giving insight on how you may improve in a group, maybe I am too extrovert? too rigid in my processes and need to more open minded. I will try and explore these traits before the group projects start.

### How should you take this into account when forming a team?

Try and align myself with other individuals that have high competencies to get a balanced group. Be mindful of my strong traits and possibly dial back a bit and listen. 

# Project Idea
## Overview
I have started developing an Android Application for my work. We all currently rotate on a 4 on and 4 off (2 x 12-hour day shifts, 2 x 12-hour night shifts), some shifts not all attract penalty rates which can make knowing what you are being paid difficult. The application calculates 26 fortnights of wages (including shift penalties) and displays the net amount for the user. It allows for sick leave, annual leave, shift swapping via an editable roster page. The idea that if the user wants to know what is coming in on payday this is a quick reference.

## Motivation
There is currently an Excel spreadsheet that has been developed over many years, is extremely accurate and widely used. Its main problem though is it uses Microsoft Excel and must be used from a Laptop/Desktop computer that has VB capabilities. So, if you just want to know what is being deposited in a particular fortnight you need to fire up a computer, wait for it to load, get into excel and navigate to the tab on the sheet. 
The app will be a one tap display of your current net pay. A lot of people at my workplace have shown a great interest for this.

## Description 
The app will be designed initially on Android Studio using Java programming language and xml style android tabs. The design will be a bottom navigation pane with 2 options for “Fortnight Pay” and “Settings”. It will be available on Google’s Play Store at a cost of $10 to the user, Ad free.

The intention to port to Apple IOS at a later date (after I learn how to create IOS applications because at the moment I haven’t even looked at it).

On startup, the application will ask you what site of ESTA (Emergency Services Telecommunications Authority) you currently work at (Ballarat, Melbourne, Burwood) as the rosters are slightly different at each center.
It will then ask the user to input their primary service (Police, CFA/MFB, Ambulance) as this also changes the roster format. The current pay level the user is on (6 different levels, that changes the base rate), the current crew they are working on to work out the days rostered, if the user has a HELP/SFSS debt to work out extra tax and how many current hours or annual/personal leave entitled.

After the initial setup the primary tab on the application will be “Fortnight Pay” which will display 14 (editable) days of the fortnight with the shift the user is rostered to work, then in big bold text the net amount being deposited.
The user will be able to edit any of the 14 days displayed from a drop-down box (to eliminate input errors) to either day, night, afternoon, personal leave, annual leave or leave without pay.

It will need to have a function that in the scenario of a user going up in pay level or changing crew that it will update the remaining fortnights following the change.

The application will also calculate if the user takes leave (annual/personal) and update the running total of entitlements to the user. Also adding 7.45 hours of leave to every fortnight worked keeping in mind it does not accrue when the user does not have enough personal leave entitlements.

I have spoken to ESTA management about this and agreed upon the terms that it must not have any ESTA logo’s, references and must be submitted prior to putting the application live on the Google Play Store.

## Tools and Technologies
I will be using Android Studio which is based on JetBrains’ IntelliJ IDEA software. The application will be coded in Java programming language and the GUI in xml files which Android Studio creates for the developer but also allows to manual editing.

My old laptop (2011 Toshiba 15”) made doing any software development difficult due to screen size and processing power so as a result I have purchased a new Acer Predator 17” laptop (primarily for my RMIT course) 2 Phillips 25” monitors which are wall mounted to make it easy to have code 1 side and final product the other side as well as the Oracle website for referencing methods. 

## Skills Required 
The skills needed to create such an application is adept knowledge in Java programming language and adept knowledge using android studio. The functions of the code will need to be designed before starting to make sure it all flows and is easily upgradeable in the future.

The minimum hardware requirement for this application will be any smart device running android 7.0 or later due to needing access to modules not included in previous android versions. Most devices today meet these requirements with less than 16% of the worlds android devices using Android 6.0 and below (none of them would be at a communications company)

I envision doing this project solo due to knowing the requirements of the workplace, but I believe the project would benefit from some sort of design as I feel I lack in the area of making GUI’s pretty.


## Outcome
If this is successful, the outcome would be a lot of happy 000 employees who like to know how much are they getting paid every fortnight without having to wait 10-15 minutes to find a computer/laptop and boot it up.

This will change things for a lot of employees who need to make decisions based on their wages (I know not everyone lives pay to pay but a lot do). In a down week of only week day shifts (no penalties) you might try and pickup some overtime and vice versa if your normal roster is all weekend shifts (very high penalties) you may want to purchase that new laptop and 2 new screens because the budget allows.

Also, the learning benefits for the developer, Multiple java files and activity xml’s, 2D arrays and HashMap’s! How do you even get an app on the Play Store? Well now I know…
