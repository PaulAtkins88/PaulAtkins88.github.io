It is an engineering company, Sure there to make a buck but I believe are successful due to wanting to make the world of electronic engineering better than before.

They want a post grad, assuming adept knowledge in programming in some languages, not all. Understanding of IT, Software Development. Also mentions experience in networking prograaming (Assuming routing tables, maintaining patches, PowerShell). Experience in multiple OS (Operating Systems).
